# Sprout Homebrew Tap

This is the official Homebrew tap for [Sprout](https://github.com/m44rten1/sprout).

**Sprout** is a CLI tool that manages your Git worktrees so you don't have to. It keeps your project directories clean by tucking worktrees away in `~/.sprout`.

## 🍺 Installation

```bash
brew install m44rten1/sprout/sprout
```

Or, if you prefer to tap first:

```bash
brew tap m44rten1/sprout
brew install sprout
```

## 🔄 Updating

```bash
brew update
brew upgrade m44rten1/sprout/sprout  # or: brew upgrade sprout
```

If Homebrew cannot find the formula, tap first: `brew tap m44rten1/sprout`.
If the formula was pinned, run `brew unpin sprout` before upgrading.
